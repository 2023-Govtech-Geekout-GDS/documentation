# 2.1 Fetching To Do

In the this exercise, we'll be learning how to interact with our backend server using api request libraries and state components to retrieve todo entries that we have created in the previous backend exercises

Begin the exercise with the branch `checkpoint-0`:

> `git checkout checkpoint-0`

> I want to see all the todo entires I have added during the backend exercises

In this exercise, we will learn to write a GET request to fetch todo entries from our backend server
