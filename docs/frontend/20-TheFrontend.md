# 2.0 The Frontend

This topic covers a couple of basic things about frontend development. Along the way, we'll cover concepts like components, state, hooks, and events.

In the first exercise, we'll learn the different components that makes up the todo application.

In the second exercise, we'll be learning how to interact with our backend server using api request libraries and state components to retrieve todo entries that we have created in the previous backend exercises

In the third exercise, we will learn how to use write a request to add new todo entries using event handlers

Lastly, we'll ensure that the to-do item is a valid one.

To spin up the local development environment, navigate to the main folder and the following:

Begin the exercise with the branch `checkpoint-0`:
- Run `git checkout checkpoint-0` on your terminal, and let's begin!
- Run `npm install` to install the application dependencies
- Run `npm start` to look at the todo app interface

Spend some time to experiment with the `todo.js` application code. Remove components to see how it affect the user interface.
