# 2.0 The Frontend

This topic covers a couple of basic things about frontend development.

In the first exercise, we'll learn how to add a button to the page that, when clicked, adds a new to-do item to the list.
Along the way, we'll cover concepts like components, state, hooks, and events.

In the second exercise, we'll add a simple checkbox to track the state of each to-do item, and turn it into a controlled component with a bit of code.

Lastly, we'll ensure that the to-do item is a valid one.

To spin up the local development environment, navigate to the main folder and run `docker-compose up`.

Begin the exercise with the branch `checkpoint-0`:

Run `git checkout checkpoint-0` on your terminal, and let's begin!
