# 1. Getting Started

## Launching the Development Environment

> ðŸ’¡ Prerequisite: Do ensure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your local machine! Also, make sure that Docker desktop is running on the background!

Fork the below repositories
>ðŸ’¡ Ensure that `Copy the main branch only` is `unchecked` so that the branches are forked too! If not you won't be able to see the branches.

1. Frontend: https://github.com/2023-Govtech-Geekout-GDS/frontend.git
2. Backend: https://github.com/2023-Govtech-Geekout-GDS/backend.git

Firstly, clone your repositories after forking and navigate into the main codebase
> Replace `<replace-with-your-github-username>` with your GitHub username e.g. thefiend

```console
mkdir eng-bootcamp-2022 &&
cd eng-bootcamp-2022 &&
git clone https://github.com/<replace-with-your-github-username>/frontend.git &&
git clone https://github.com/<replace-with-your-github-username>/backend.git
```

Checkout to the exercise branch in Backend and Frontend applications

> `cd` into the backend and frontend directories to checkout to checkpoint 0


```console
cd frontend && git checkout checkpoint-0 && cd .. &&
cd backend && git checkout checkpoint-0
```

<!-- ## Start Server Locally

Run the command below:

Start the servers
```console
docker-compose up --build
```

If running docker compose in detached mode instead (`docker-compose up --build --detach`), viewing the logs of a container is simple:

```console
docker logs frontend_frontend_1
```

```console
docker logs backend_backend_1
```

To tear down the environment:

```console
docker-compose down
```

If all is good, access the locally hosted front end app at `http://localhost:3000/`
