# 0. Installation

## Launching the development environment

> ðŸ’¡ Prerequisite: Do ensure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your local machine! Also, make sure that Docker desktop is running on the background!

### 1. Docker setup:
- [MacOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install)
- [WindowsOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install)

### 2. Install Git and IDE (If required):
- [Set up Git - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [IDE: Download Visual Studio Code - Mac, Linux, Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

### 3. Install NodeJS (NPM):

> ðŸ’¡ NodeJS will serve as a runtime environment, hence it should be installed before the other pre-requisites. NodeJS also comes with the NPM package manager which we will be using for the rest of the setup.

Download and install NodeJS from the following link: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

### 4. Setup Github account:
#### a. [Create Github Account](https://github.com/signup)
#### b. Fork Github Repositories:
>ðŸ’¡ Ensure that `Copy the main branch only` is `unchecked` so that the branches are forked too! If not you won't be able to see the branches.
